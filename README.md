Disk operating system for Sim68k

Learning 68000 assembly through this project!

You can run this in Easy68K. The main file is console.x86, it loads the DOS at $1000 and floppy.ima at $200000.
Raw 68000 programs can be loaded to $800000 though there's no provision to run them quite yet. What a useful OS.
